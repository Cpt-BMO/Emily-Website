        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Emily Bakes Cake was founded by Emily Boudreaux in 2003 in Houston, Texas. </br>
            Emily has a physical storefront where
            she sells her standard products: cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and pastries. </br>
            Her specialty is customizing and
            decorating European-style cakes for her customers.</p>

        <h2>Emily's Passion</h2>
        <p>Emily’s love of baking started when she was a young girl. </br>
            Her grandmother, 
            would often include Emily whenever she was baking desserts for the family. </br>
            Mommie always said, “Everyone should
            have one special cake for their birthday or big event in their lives.” </br>
            Emily continues to honor her grandmother
            by upholding that tradition.</p>
        <p>Later in life, Emily spent several years in Europe developing her skills as a baker. </br>
            She worked in a boulangerie
            (bakery) in Paris and spent a year in Salzburg, where she learned Bavarian and Austrian baking techniques.</p>

        <h2>Baking Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Emily Bakes Cakes prides itself on baking from scratch using family recipes combined with the European baking
            skills she acquired overseas. </br>
            This approach has led to robust sales at their physical store location near the
            Galleria.</p>
